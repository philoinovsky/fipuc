# Question
1. top two advantages of using tuples?
    - as return type of functions
    - as input arguments to functions
2. in which situations would we use tuples instead of structs/classes.
    - A tuple is similar to a class but with no member functions
3. how to construct tuples
    - `std::make_tuple`
    - initializer lists
    - tuple concatenation
    - `std::tie` to create a tuple of `lvalue` ref
4. which of the following features are supported by C++ tuples?
    - associating C++ vars with a tuple's elements
    - the ability to forward elements of a tuple to a function taking tuple argument
    - concatenating tuples
    - tuples, some of those elements can be universal function wrappers
5. main difference between tuples and sets in C++?
    - wut?
