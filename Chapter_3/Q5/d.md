- Consider how to define and configure a small framework to allow a developer to compute an approximate integral for a range of scalar-valued functions of a single variable.
    - We shall discuss STL numerical algorithms in Chapters 17 and 18. In Chapter 19 we discuss the numerical solution of nonlinear equations which is similar in style to the design issues in this exercise
- Answer
```
1. just like this! function object!
2. pass function everytime / use built in function and select the function by using CONSTANTS
```
